# Schengen-Visa-Management-database
In this project, I have created a relational database for Schengen visa management. There are Schengen countries and they have their respective embassies where the applicant submits their visa applications for various purposes and embassies process approve/reject their applications. There are many Schengen countries like Austria, Germany, Italy and each country has their respective embassies in non-Schengen country. Each embassy has a list of visa officers who process applications received by their respective embassy. Applicants provide their personal details along with passport which is mandatory. Applicant can be of three types student applicant, tourist applicant, working applicant. However, their purpose could be for many cases like transiting, tourism, education and business. Each application must have one country as their main destination/first entry in Schengen area. Each application must have details of financial status, travel insurance and travel itinerary. Visas are of three types Uniform Schengen Visa, Limited Territorial Validity Visa and National Visas. Based on their purpose and application they are granted one of visas above and visa entry type which can be single, double, multiple entry. For single entry once, applicant completes his travel the visa is deemed inactive. In case of double entry applicant can travel two times in and out of Schengen area and there is no restriction on multiple entry.
